## Overview

Want to sing songs with friends at home?
Have an audio, a mixer, and mikes, but find it complicated to log songs?
Wonder KTV is here to help!

Wonder KTV is a web app that allow users to search and play song videos.
One can enter as a guest to get into the guest room, or register and log in as a registered user.
Registered users can create their own rooms or enter other rooms.
Inside the room, users can add songs, change the board and see others in the room.
Registered users can also access their history of songs they had added.
(Currently, the song videos are loaded from Youtube)


## Data Model

The application will store TheHall, Rooms, Users, Playlists, Songs, Histories, and Records.

* The hall has multiple rooms
* Each room has a playlist, a board, and multiple users
* Each playlist can have multiple songs
* Each user has a history
* Each history can have multiple records

Sample Documents:

An Example Hall with Embedded Rooms:

```javascript
[
  {
    name: "Guest Room",
    playlist: [songId1, songId2, ...],
    members: [guestId1, ...],
    board: "Happy Birthday To HappyDog!"
  },
  {
    name: "happyDog's room",
    playlist: [songId1, songId2, ...],
    members: [memberId1, ...],
    board: "Happy Birthday!"
  },
  // ...other rooms
]
```

An Example Song:

```javascript
{
  id: //...generated by db,
  name: "Two Tiger (original)",
  path: // youtubeVideoId,
  accompanient: true,  // original or with accompaniment
  duration: "3min12s",
  description: // youtube video name: youtube video description
}
```


An Example User:

```javascript
{
  registered: true,   // if false, then identified as a guest
  username: "happyDog",
  password: // a hashed password,
  history: // id to the history document in histories collection
  room: //room id the user is currently in, null if not in any room
}
```

An Example History with Embedded Record:

```javascript
{
  id: //...generated by db,
  user: //...userId,
  records: [
    {
      timeAdded: //...time,
      song: //...songId
    }
  ]
}
```
